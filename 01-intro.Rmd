California has at least 29 native species and varieties of oaks (*Quercus* species), as well as many natural interspecies hybrids. California native oaks ranges from large trees, up to about 25 m tall, to shrubs no taller than about 1.5 m. Traditionally, California native oaks have been assigned to three subgroups commonly referred to as white oaks (including *Q. douglasii*, *Q. engelmanii*, *Q. lobata*, *Q. garryana* and various scrub oaks), black oaks (including *Q. agrifolia*, *Q. kelloggii*, *Q. parvula*, and *Q. wislizeni*), and intermediate oaks (including *Q. chrysolepis* and *Q. vaccinifolia*). More recent infrageneric classifications of oaks (subgenera, sections, and subsections) has reshuffled some of these groups as shown in the Table 1.1 below [@Manos2021]. These subgeneric classifications are significant because hybridization only occurs between oaks in the same subgroups. Furthermore, some insects, pathogens, and other agents selectively colonize or damage oaks in certain subgroups.

Oak woodlands and other vegetation types dominated by oak trees cover about 3 million hectares in California or roughly 7.5% of the stateâ€™s land area [@Bolsinger1988].  California native oaks also occur as components in desert plant communities, chaparral, and conifer-dominated forest ecosystems (figure \@ref(fig:Oakrng)).

Remnant native oaks have also become incorporated into developed areas within many California communities.  The importance of oaks in the California landscape is reflected in the large number of California cities, localities, and geographic features that include references to oaks in either English or Spanish (encina, roble). In many urbanized landscapes, as in wildlands throughout much of California, individual oaks and oak woodlands are critical elements of the ecosystem.

Oak woodlands provide extremely important wildlife habitat and have higher levels of biodiversity than virtually any other terrestrial ecosystem in California.  At least 300 terrestrial vertebrate species [@Tietje2005], 1,300 native vascular plant species (https://www.calflora.org/), 370 fungal species, and an estimated 5,000 arthropod species [@Swiecki1997] are associated with California oak woodlands.

This publication focuses on the relatively small number of microorganisms (primarily fungi) and arthropods (primarily insects) that are capable of causing noticeable damage to oaks in California. We have included agents that cause serious damage to oaks, as well as some common agents that are associated with obvious symptoms even if they are not especially detrimental to oak health.  Conspicuous but relatively inconsequential agents, such as cynipid gall wasps, often attract more attention than more cryptic agents, such as canker rot fungi, that can severely impact oak health and structural integrity. Some agents that have little or no impact on oak health may still create a nuisance in urban settings as the result of materials that are shed (e.g., sap) or because they adversely affect the appearance of oaks in the landscape.

Sudden oak death, caused by the introduced pathogen *Phytophthora ramorum*, emerged as a major disease of several California oaks around 1995 and has killed millions of oak and tanoak trees (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*) within infested areas of coastal California [@Cobb2020]. The impact of this serious pathogen highlighted the need for readily available information about agents that damage oaks in California and led to the development of the 2006 version of this Field Guide. Since then, an increasing number of invasive organisms that cause oak mortality or degrade oak health, including the goldspotted oak borer (*Agrilus auroguttatus*), have become established in California. The new online version of this publication was developed to allow for continuous updating of this reference in response to new agents and information. The California Oak Disease and Arthropod (CODA) database (http://coda.phytosphere.com) is a companion resource to this Field Guide and provides much more comprehensive compilation of agents that feed on, colonize, and/or damage oaks in California.

This publication is primarily intended to help arborists, land managers, pest management specialists, and other professionals identify and assess the likely impacts of agents that attack oaks in California. It includes many endemic or naturalized agents as well as more recently introduced exotic agents. We have incorporated enough technical information to make this document useful for professionals, but property owners and other members of the general public can also use this publication to better understand common oak diseases and pests.

The included range maps are approximate because the distributions of many agents have not been full documented. These ranges are also subject to expansion over time, especially in the case of introdiuced agents. For most agents, we have  used county boundaries to show the reported range. Agents may also occur beyond the illustrated ranges and are not necessarily found in all portions of the illustrated ranges.  

Information on agent biology, host range, and importance provided in this publication will be helpful for determining whether management actions are likely to be necessary or practical. However, this publication does not provide specific recommendations for the management of the described pests and diseases. Readers interested in current management recommendations should consult the University of California Integrated Pest Management website (http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/) or their local University of California Cooperation Extension office.
