## Oak leaf blister {-}

### *Taphrina caerulescens*  {-}

#### Distribution / Hosts {-}

*Taphrina caerulescens* is reported to affect more than 50 species of oaks in the North America, Mexico, Europe, and Asia. In California, this pathogen is reported on native blue, valley, Engelmann, California black, and coast live
oak and on some non-native oaks. Oaks in the subsection Lobatae (red/black oaks) are generally more susceptible than those in subsection Quercus (white oaks).

#### Symptoms {-}

Rounded, wrinkled blisters develop on the upper surface of young leaves (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis2A)). These blisters appear as depressions when the lower leaf surface is viewed. Blisters range in size from 3 to 30 mm and sometimes coalesce, affecting large areas of the leaf. Severe leaf distortion may result, and young leaves may drop if heavily infected. Blisters are initially light green, yellowish, or whitish on the upper leaf surface and yellow-brown to gray on the underside of the leaf (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis2B)). As blisters age, their upper surfaces may turn reddish or purplish and then brown. On coast live oak, symptoms caused by erineum mites mayappear similar to oak leaf blister. Inspection of symptomatic tissues under a microscope may be necessary to confirm whether symptoms are associated with erineum mites or *T. caerulescens*.

#### Agent Description {-}

All life stages of this fungus are microscopic. Fungal mycelium develops just below the leaf cuticle and between epidermal cells.No distinct fruiting body is formed. Sexual spores (ascospores) are produced in club-shaped, sac-like structures (asci) that form in a layer beneath the upper or lower leaf cuticle and eventually break through the leaf surface. Eight ascospores are formed in
each ascus, but ascospores can produce additional asexual spores (conidia) by budding, which may occur within the ascus. All fungal tissue is initially colorless, but the layer of asci darkens after spores are released.

#### Biology {-}

The fungus overwinters as spores (ascospores and conidia) in bark cracks and under bud scales. In the spring, young, germinating spores infect expanding leaves primarily through stomata. After ascospores are released, they may continue to grow as saprophytes on plant surfaces in a yeast-like
form, reproducing asexually by budding. Initial infection and subsequent saprophytic growth are favored by mild, wet conditions. Usually only one disease cycle occurs per year in California.

#### Importance {-}

In California, oak leaf blister is generally uncommon and typically does not cause substantial damage when present. In the southeastern U.S. and Gulf Coast states, disease is commonly more severe, leading to a high amount of early defoliation in some years.

## *Tubakia californica* {-}

#### Distribution / Hosts {-}
*Tubakia californica* is widespread and likely native to California.  As of 2025  it had not been reported outside the state. Reported hosts are all in the plant family Fagaceae, and include California black oak, coast live oak, interior live oak, and valley oak, as well as tanoak, and golden chinquapin.

knitr::include_graphics("images/distributions/Tubcal.png")
```


#### Symptoms {-}
Symptoms of leaf spots, which begin either at the edge of the leaf or at the base of the petiole, appear in late summer to early fall depending on the climatic zone and elevation. Spots coalesce to form larger areas along the leaf margin or spread along the leaf veins, blackening the veins and eventually killing the leaf (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis5A)). Infections may spread into the subtending twig (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis5C))

On the deciduous California black oak, dead leaves remain attached and hanging from branches throughout the winter and through the next  year (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis5B)). Defoliation on the evergreen tanoak appears most severe in early spring before new leaves emerge. Severely affected trees can sometimes lose enough leaves in the lower three-quarters of the crowns for the lower crown to appear noticeably sparse.

On coast live oak symptoms appear low in the tree crown and are more severe in topographically low or humid areas (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis5D)). Symptoms can also be severe along road corridors, especially those that follow canyon bottoms.

#### Agent Description {-}

Most *Tubakia* species are characterized by the production of rounded shield-shaped asexual fungal fruiting structures (pycnothyria) where asexual spores (conidia) are formed.  When *T. californica* was originally described, these pycnothyria had not been found and were not described [@braun2018tubakia]. Small pycnothyria have since been found on petioles in a single location in Sonoma Co. The conidia producing fungal structures that were observed on affected leaves and petioles were tiny, black, and crustose, usually (50–)80–200(–220) μm diam (about the width of a human hair) and resemble pycnidia (a flask shaped fruiting body with a narrow opening). The pycnidia-like structures of *T. californica*  release conidia through irregular fissures. The conidia are ellipsoid to ellipsoid-oval. Under a microscope conidia initially appear not quite clear (subhyaline) and as they age they become greenish. They range in size from 8-15 x 4.5-7µm [@braun2018tubakia].   

Other fungi in the genus *Tubakia* that are well-known foliar and twig pathogens of oaks include *T. dryina* and *T. iowensis*.  Although *T. californica* appears to be common and widespread in California, it was not described until 2018 [@braun2018tubakia]. This may be because it was thought to be *T. dryina* or other fungal pathogens such as *Apiognomonia errabunda*, which can occur together with *T. californica* on the same leaf tissue. Conidia of *A. errabunda* are similar in length as *T. californica* but usually more narrow (3-5µm) and remain hyaline.


#### Biology {-}

*T. californica* most likely lives endophytically (inside of without causing disease) in twig and leaf tissues. What causes it to emerge as a pathogen of these tissues is unknown. It is likely that disease incidence and severity is correlated with microclimatic conditions that increase the frequency and duration of leaf wetness and promote pathogen persistence and spread. In California black oak, infections often result in trees not fully defoliating in late fall. These infected leaves with asexual fruiting structures overwinter and likely provide the primary inoculum (spores that initiate new infections) when new leaves emerge the following spring in years with plentiful spring rainfall.

#### Importance {-}

Trees stressed by repeated or severe infection may be more susceptible to various opportunistic agents that may contribute to tree decline and mortality.

## Early defoliation due to drought stress {-}

### Abiotic {#drought .unnumbered}

#### Distribution / Hosts {-}

Early defoliation related to prolonged drought stress is most commonly seen in blue oak and can occur throughout its range. It is most common on drought-prone sites, such as areas with shallow or rocky soils, and more likely to occur in areas experiencing low rainfall and high summer temperatures. Other oak species can also be affected by severe drought stress, but early leaf browning and leaf drop is only commonly reported in blue oak.

knitr::include_graphics("images/distributions/early browning.gif")
```


#### Symptoms {-}

In low rainfall years, leaves of mature trees turn brown prematurely and begin to drop well in advance of the normal November-December leaf drop period (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis1)). This drought–deciduous characteristic is seen in a more extreme form in California buckeye and is also common in chaparral and desert plants. Drought-induced defoliation can be differentiated from branch dieback by the fact that buds and twigs of drought-defoliated branches remain alive and normally leaf out the following spring. In 1987, following extreme drought conditions in the preceding rainy season, foliar browning and leaf drop in blue oak occurred by mid-August in affected areas. During droughts lasting multiple years, symptoms may be widespread. In less extreme drought years, only blue oaks growing in drought-prone areas may be affected, and defoliation may occur later in the season, but still earlier than the usual late fall leaf drop.

Blue oak seedling advance regeneration also undergoes early defoliation in response to drought stress. Blue oak advance regeneration typically consists of persistent understory seedlings less than about 10–15 cm tall that range in age from a few years to decades. Drought-stressed seedlings may begin losing leaves by June or July (figure \@ref(fig:LfDis2)). Drought stress in seedlings is strongly influenced by competition with both overstory trees and non-native understory grasses and forbs. Young seedling shoots may also die back partly or completely to ground level by midsummer in response to severe drought stress.

#### Biology {-}

Blue oak may be the most drought-tolerant of California’s tree-sized oaks. Early defoliation in response to extreme drought reduces water loss to a minimum and presumably favors tree survival under these conditions. One year of early defoliation had no discernable effect on tree health in one study [@mccreary1990blue]. Trees that defoliated early were among the earliest to leaf out the following spring. However, some trees that defoliated early in response to the extreme 1976–1977 drought (the most severe drought in California during the 20th century) were subsequently leafless for an entire growing season before leafing out in the following year. 

The combination of longer hotter summers and drought conditions, can increase water stress in blue oak and other oaks to lethal levels. Excessive levels of blue oak mortality were documented in the southern Sierra Nevada in response to the megadrought that affected much of California from 2013 through 2016 [@Das2020]. Drought-related oak decline and mortality are most likely to occur with low available water storage in surface soils and deeper subsoil or fractured rock layers, on hotter south and west-facingslopes, and where high stand densities create greater competition for moisture. Drought stress can also favor the activity and damage caused by various oak pests and pathogens, and these interactions may accelerate tree decline and mortality. 

Early seasonal defoliation is one of the factors that suppress understory advance regeneration. Well-established seedling advance regeneration can resprout from the base to produce new shoots if the previous season’s shoot has been completely killed by drought. However, successive years of early defoliation and shoot death are associated with reduced seedling survival.

#### Importance {-}

Climate change has increased temperatures for longer periods during the growing season, causing severe drought stress to occur progressively earlier in the season. When combined with multi-year droughts and poor site conditions, substantial negative effects on the health and survival of blue oak and other native oaks can occur. The magnitude of these effects can be lessened in more favorable sites, such as where deep soil or subsoil moisture reserves can be tapped by oak roots. Consequently, effects associated with drought-stress can vary both regionally and locally. 

Historically, mature blue oaks have periodically endured periods of severe water stress, which have induced early defoliation. If the frequency and duration of these events increase, blue oak may not be sustainable in some portions of its historic range. Other impacts, such as root damage due to construction-related activity, exacerbate drought-related effects and can accelerate tree decline. Drought-induced defoliation and shoot dieback reduce the survival of blue oak seedlings and are commonly a contributing factor to poor regeneration in blue oak stands.
