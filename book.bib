   abstract = {The oak flora of North America north of Mexico is both phylogenetically diverse and species-rich, including 92 species placed in five sections of subgenus Quercus, the oak clade centered on the Americas. Despite phylogenetic and taxonomic progress on the genus over the past 45 years, classification of species at the subsectional level remains unchanged since the early treatments by WL Trelease, AA Camus, and CH Muller. In recent work, we used a RAD-seq based phylogeny including 250 species sampled from throughout the Americas and Eurasia to reconstruct the timing and biogeography of the North American oak radiation. This work demonstrates that the North American oak flora comprises mostly regional species radiations with limited phylogenetic affinities to Mexican clades, and two sister group connections to Eurasia. Using this framework, we describe the regional patterns of oak diversity within North America and formally classify 62 species into nine major North American subsections within sections Lobatae (the red oaks) and Quercus (the white oaks), the two largest sections of subgenus Quercus. We also distill emerging evolutionary and biogeographic patterns based on the impact of phylogenomic data on the systematics of multiple species complexes and instances of hybridization.},

   abstract = {The California Oak Disease and Arthropod (CODA) host index database is a compilation of information on agents that colonize or feed on oaks in California. Agents in the database include plant-feeding insects and mites, nematodes, microorganisms, viruses, and abiotic disease agents. CODA contains summarized information on hosts, agents, information sources, and the details of the host-agent interaction. Most of the 853 insect species in CODA are in the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Homoptera. About 40 percent of the 378 species of fungi in CODA are pathogens. Of these, basidiomycete wood decay fungi have the most significant ecological impact. L andowners and resource managers need to consider the effects of diseases and arthropod pests on oaks when formulating management plans for oak woodlands or individual oaks. Over the past century, many different researchers have described a wide array of diseases and arthropods that affect oaks in California. However, the reports are found in numerous sources, many of which are not readily available to professionals involved with oak management in California. As part of a project to study the impacts of diseases and arthropods on California rangeland oaks (Swiecki and others 1990, 1991a, 1991b), we set out to compile the existing information on agents affecting oaks in California. Our goal was to organize this information in a format that was readily accessible and easy to update. We developed a computerized database, the California Oak Disease and Arthropod (CODA) Host Index (Swiecki and others 1996), to store and organize preexisting and new information on arthropods, microorganisms, and abiotic factors that affect oak health in California. Methods Review of Literature and Unpublished Data We obtained records for CODA from both published and unpublished sources. We reviewed numerous synoptic references and review articles and searched several computerized bibliographic databases, including AGRICOLA, BIOSIS, Entomological Abstracts, and CAB Abstracts, to obtain occurrence records. We subsequently checked most records against the original articles to verify each report and obtain additional information on the host-agent interaction. Although we consulted nearly 2,000 publications during the literature review, our review of the literature was not necessarily complete for all groups of agents, particularly the insects. Because of time and budget constraints, we focused our initial efforts on groups of agents that were likely to cause noticeable damage to oaks. We restricted our initial search for arthropod records to phytophagous insects and mites, concentrating on taxa that are known pests of oaks or other deciduous trees in California and elsewhere. In searching for records on microbial agents, we concentrated our efforts on known or likely pathogens. We also obtained unpublished records in the form of database files and card files from various sources,},

   abstract = {This chapter provides local planners and policymakers with information on the diversity and abundance of oak woodland wildlife, wildlife habitat needs, and how local planning activities can influence wildlife abundance and diversity. Federal and state laws, particularly the federal and California Endangered Species Act and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), require local governments to include wildlife needs in land-use planning. Increasingly, local governments must account for the impacts of their activities on wildlife. The future of oak woodland wildlife depends on how we plan and manage oak woodlands in the face of increasing pressure from recreation and development. Habitat offers resident wildlife food, cover, water, and living space. California's oak woodlands are some of the richest wildlife habitat in the state. Of the 632 terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) native to California, over 300 species use oak woodlands for food, cover, and reproduction, including at least 120 species of mammals, 147 species of birds, and approximately 60 species of amphibians and reptiles. Each species of wildlife has different habitat requirements. For example, the band-tailed pigeon (Columba fasciata) consumes acorns and leaf buds, while the blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) gleans insects from oak twigs and foliage. The mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) requires about a thousand acres of oak habitat to satisfy all its food, water, and cover needs, but the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) uses less than an acre. Habitat needs of wildlife may also change with the seasons. The acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) eats acorns during fall and winter, but must forage for insects in spring to feed its nestlings. Similarly, the cover needed by wildlife during the summer may be much different than that required to survive in winter. Habitat Structure Habitat components found in oak woodlands are distributed both horizontally and vertically across the landscape. For instance, across the countryside, varying proportions of rock outcrops, shrubs, trees, and watercourses create a horizontal landscape mosaic of habitat patches of varying sizes, referred to as horizontal structure. Man is that uniquely conscious creature who can perceive and express. He must become the steward of the biosphere. To do this, he must design with nature.-Ian McHarg 15 Published in: Giusti, Gregory A.; McCreary, Douglas D.; Standiford, Richard B., editors. 2005.
